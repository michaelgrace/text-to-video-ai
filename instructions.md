## Current Storage Locations

1. **Audio Files**: 
   - Generated audio files are saved as `audio_tts.wav` in the root project directory (see `app.py` line 22)
   - Not stored in any persistent location
   TASK: PLEASE MODIFY THE CODE SUCH THAT audio_tts.wav is save in the output/audio folder.  this folder will be populated by the current method changing only its destination folder from root to output/audio.  do this task only.  Never refactor or change any code not related this task

2. **Video Output**: 
   - Final rendered video is saved as `rendered_video.mp4` in the root directory (see `render_engine.py` line 36)
   - Not stored in any persistent location
      TASK: PLEASE MODIFY THE CODE SUCH THAT `rendered_video.mp4 is save in the output/video folder.  this folder will be populated by the current method changing only its destination folder from root to output/video.  do this task only.  Never refactor or change any code not related this task

3. **Captions**: 
   - Timed captions are generated in memory and passed directly to the rendering engine
   - Not persisted to the filesystem
        TASK: PLEASE MODIFY THE CODE SUCH THAT `captions_text.srt is save in the output/captions folder.  this folder will be populated by the current method changing only its destination folder from root to output/captions.  do this task only.  Never refactor or change any code not related this task

4. **Logs**:
   - API responses are stored in `.logs/gpt_logs` and `.logs/pexel_logs`
   - These are created by the `log_response` function in `utility/utils.py`

## Docker Configuration

In `docker-compose.yml`, the following volumes are already configured:
- `./:/app` - Maps the entire local project directory to `/app` in the container
- `./temp:/app/temp` - Maps the local temp directory for downloaded video clips

## Verdict

You're correct. Based on the current code, you don't need to change anything for persistent storage of the generated files. The audio file (`audio_tts.wav`) and the final video (`rendered_video.mp4`) are already being created in the project's root directory, which is accessible from VS Code.

When running with Docker, the `./:/app` volume mapping ensures all files created in the container's `/app` directory (including the root directory files) are automatically available in your local project folder.

If you want to organize outputs better in the future, you could consider modifying `app.py` and `render_engine.py` to save their outputs to a specific directory, but this isn't necessary for accessing the files from VS Code.
