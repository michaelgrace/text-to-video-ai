To remove upstream and manage your repository privacy, here's what you need to do:
## Manual log of changes

4/16/2025 2:01 pm Stablized app after docker conversion: had to roll back some file management changes that led to isolating the blocking issue that broke the video gen. 
- RESTORE HASH: 37b71ee55e664a93470fd1b9dcc6d49386e79af0


## Remove Upstream Permanently

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "d:\live\Documents\GitHub\Text-To-Video-AI"

# Check current remote connections
git remote -v

# Remove upstream permanently
git remote remove upstream

## To Add Upstream Back

If you want to re-establish the connection to the original repository you forked from, you can add it back with this command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/michaelgrace/Text-To-Video-AI.git
```

# Verify upstream has been removed
git remote -v
```

## Commit Changes to Main Branch

```powershell
# Add any modified files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Fix MoviePy ImageMagick integration and improve captions configuration" -m "
1. Fixed MoviePy configuration:
   - Simplified ImageMagick binary path setup
   - Properly imported moviepy.config to resolve module loading issues
   - Set IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY directly to fix Docker compatibility

2. Improved caption generation:
   - Increased default maxCaptionSize from 15 to 40 characters
   - Reduces scene transitions for smoother viewing experience

3. Added build improvements:
   - Updated Docker configuration for ImageMagick
   - Added proper configuration for Docker BuildKit
"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```
To get the hash of your most recent commit (check-in) in Git, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

This will output the full SHA-1 hash of the current HEAD commit.

If you want a shorter version of the hash, you can use:

```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD
```

This will give you a shorter (usually 7 characters) version of the hash that is often sufficient for reference purposes.


To retrieve all the code from a specific commit hash in Git, you can use the following approaches:

1. View the files at that specific commit:

```bash
git show 2b28f6287083d7da378ef389117257d13f655d6b
```

2. Checkout the specific commit to a new branch (to explore it without affecting your current branch):

```bash
git checkout -b temp-branch 2b28f6287083d7da378ef389117257d13f655d6b
```

3. Extract all files from that commit to a directory:

```bash
git archive --format=zip 2b28f6287083d7da378ef389117257d13f655d6b --output=d:/live/Documents/GitHub/Text-To-Video-AI/commit-files.zip
```

4. To see the differences between that commit and its parent:

```bash
git diff 2b28f6287083d7da378ef389117257d13f655d6b^..2b28f6287083d7da378ef389117257d13f655d6b
```

The most common approach is option 2 (creating a temporary branch) if you want to explore the codebase at that point in time.

## Regarding Repository Privacy

Unfortunately, you cannot make a forked repository private directly through a command. This requires using the GitHub website:

1. Go to GitHub.com and log in
2. Navigate to your Text-To-Video-AI fork
3. Click the "Settings" tab
4. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone"
5. Click "Change repository visibility"
6. Select "Private" and confirm

If you want to maintain a completely private copy, the alternative is to create a new private repository and push your code there:

```powershell
# Create a new private repository
gh repo create Text-To-Video-AI-private --private

# Add the new repository as a remote
git remote add private https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Text-To-Video-AI-private.git

# Push your code to the new private repository
git push -u private main --tags
```

This gives you a truly private copy while keeping the original fork intact.

Based on your `git remote -v` output, you don't currently have an upstream remote configured. This is expected if you:

1. Haven't added an upstream remote yet, or
2. Have already removed it (using `git remote remove upstream`)



## Note: Do You Need Upstream?

You only need to add the upstream remote if you want to:
1. Pull in changes from the original repository
2. Stay updated with the original project's development

If you're planning to develop independently without merging changes from the original project, you don't need to add the upstream remote back.


# Retrieving Your Original Commit

If you've botched the check-in and need to go back to the original state, here are steps to recover:

## Option 1: If You Haven't Yet Pushed Successfully

If your push was rejected and you haven't made a successful push yet, you can easily revert to your last good state:

```bash
# View your recent commits to identify where to go back to
git log --oneline -n 10

# Reset to the commit before you tried removing .env 
# Replace abc1234 with the actual commit hash you want to return to
git reset --hard abc1234

# Your working directory is now back to that commit
```

## Option 2: If You've Made Multiple Commits Trying to Fix

```bash
# Find the commit you want to return to
git reflog

# Reset to that specific commit
# Replace abc1234 with the actual commit hash
git reset --hard abc1234
```

## Option 3: Create a New Branch from the Good Commit

This preserves your current main branch while creating a clean branch:

```bash
# Identify the good commit
git log --oneline -n 10

# Create a new branch from that commit
# Replace abc1234 with the commit hash
git branch clean-start abc1234

# Switch to that branch
git checkout clean-start

# Now you can work on this clean branch
```

## Option 4: Just Fix the Current State

If your only issue was the .env file, and you've now removed it from tracking:

```bash
# Make sure .env is properly ignored
git status

# If everything looks good, just continue with your work
# To undo the last commit (if it was just about removing .env)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Which approach would work best for your situation depends on exactly what state your repo is in now and which commit you want to get back to.

# Project Backup Script

Here's a PowerShell script to create a backup of your project with a timestamp in the folder name:

```powershell
# Backup script for Text-To-Video-AI project
# One-click backup to D:\live\Documents\GitHub\_versions

# Get current date and time in the correct format
$date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
$time = Get-Date -Format "HH-mm"

# Project name from current directory 
$projectName = Split-Path -Leaf (Get-Location)

# Create the backup directory name with timestamp
$backupDir = "D:\live\Documents\GitHub\_versions\$projectName - $date - $time"

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
if (!(Test-Path "D:\live\Documents\GitHub\_versions")) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "D:\live\Documents\GitHub\_versions" -Force
}

# Create a new directory for this backup
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backupDir -Force

# Copy all files and folders except .git, node_modules, etc.
$excludeFolders = @(".git", "node_modules", "venv", "__pycache__", "output", "temp")
$excludeFiles = @("*.mp4", "*.mp3", "*.wav")

# Copy files and folders
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse | Where-Object {
    # Skip excluded folders
    $skip = $false
    foreach ($folder in $excludeFolders) {
        if ($_.FullName -like "*\$folder\*" -or $_.Name -eq $folder) {
            $skip = $true
            break
        }
    }
    
    # Skip excluded file types
    if (!$skip -and $_.PSIsContainer -eq $false) {
        foreach ($pattern in $excludeFiles) {
            if ($_.Name -like $pattern) {
                $skip = $true
                break
            }
        }
    }
    
    !$skip
} | ForEach-Object {
    # Create the destination path
    $destPath = $_.FullName -replace [regex]::Escape((Get-Location).Path), $backupDir
    
    # Create directory structure if needed
    if ($_.PSIsContainer) {
        if (!(Test-Path $destPath)) {
            New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $destPath -Force | Out-Null
        }
    } else {
        # Ensure the parent directory exists
        $parentDir = Split-Path -Parent $destPath
        if (!(Test-Path $parentDir)) {
            New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $parentDir -Force | Out-Null
        }
        
        # Copy the file
        Copy-Item -Path $_.FullName -Destination $destPath -Force
    }
}

# Output success message
Write-Host "Backup completed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Project backed up to: $backupDir" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

## How to Use

1. Save this script as `backup-project.ps1` in your project root directory
2. Run the script by right-clicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell" or by running:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backup-project.ps1
   ```
3. You can also create a shortcut to the script for true one-click operation:
   - Right-click the script, select "Create shortcut"
   - Right-click the shortcut, select "Properties"
   - In the "Target" field, add `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File` before the path
   - Click "OK" and use this shortcut for one-click backup

The script excludes temporary files and directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, and media files to keep the backup size manageable.

# Understanding GitHub Recovery Capabilities

GitHub provides several ways to ensure you can recover your entire codebase if needed. Here's how you can be absolutely certain you can restore your remote files to your local machine:

## 1. Create a Full Local Backup First

Before relying solely on GitHub, create a full local backup:

```python
import os
import shutil
import datetime

# Create timestamped backup
timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
project_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
backup_dir = f"D:/Backups/Text-To-Video-AI_FULL_BACKUP_{timestamp}"

# Create backup directories
os.makedirs(backup_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Copy everything except very large files
exclude = ['.git', 'venv', '__pycache__', 'node_modules']
for item in os.listdir(project_dir):
    if item not in exclude:
        src = os.path.join(project_dir, item)
        dst = os.path.join(backup_dir, item)
        if os.path.isdir(src):
            shutil.copytree(src, dst)
        else:
            shutil.copy2(src, dst)

print(f"✅ Full backup created at: {backup_dir}")
```

## 2. Test GitHub Recovery

To verify GitHub can fully restore your code:

1. **Clone your repository to a new location to test recovery**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Text-To-Video-AI.git D:/TestRecovery
   ```

2. **Check that everything important is there**:
   - Check your code files 
   - Check configuration (except .env which should be gitignored)
   - Verify directory structure

3. **Run a file comparison** between your original and cloned repos:
   ```
   # PowerShell command to compare directories (excluding .git)
   Compare-Object -ReferenceObject (Get-ChildItem D:\live\Documents\GitHub\Text-To-Video-AI -Recurse -Exclude .git) -DifferenceObject (Get-ChildItem D:\TestRecovery -Recurse -Exclude .git)
   ```

## 3. Use Git Bundle for Offline Backup

Create a Git bundle containing your entire repository history:

```bash
# From your repository directory
git bundle create ../text-to-video-backup.bundle --all
```

This creates a single file containing your entire Git repository, which can be cloned even without GitHub access:

```bash
git clone text-to-video-backup.bundle recovered-repo
```

## Remember

1. Git/GitHub backs up your code, not your data files or environment
2. .gitignore files like .env won't be in the repository
3. Large binary files should be handled with Git LFS or kept out of the repository

These steps ensure you have multiple recovery options and can verify GitHub is correctly storing your code.

# Understanding Git Restore Options

When recovering from a corrupted local project, you have several options based on the commit hashes. Here's what happens in each case:

## Option 1: Restore from the Most Recent Commit

If you restore from the most recent commit (latest hash):
- You'll get **all changes** from all three commits
- This represents the most up-to-date state of your code
- All three sets of changes will be included

## Option 2: Restore from the Second-to-Last Commit

If you restore from the second commit:
- You'll get the first and second sets of changes
- You'll **lose the changes** from your most recent commit
- The code will be in the state before your final changes

## Option 3: Restore from Three Commits Ago

If you restore from the earliest of the three commits:
- You'll get only the baseline code from that point
- You'll **lose all changes** from the subsequent two commits
- The code will be in the oldest state of these three options

## How to Restore

```bash
# To restore to a specific commit (replace HASH with the actual hash)
git checkout HASH .

# Or to completely reset to a specific state
git reset --hard HASH
```

The important concept is that Git stores the complete state of your project at each commit, not just the differences. When you restore to a specific commit, you're getting the entire project as it existed at that point in time.

Each commit has its own hash, and each represents a complete snapshot of your code - not just the changes made in that commit.

## Note: Troubleshooting

# How to Fix the Git Push Issue After Adding .env to .gitignore

I WASTED OVER AN HOUR TRYING TO ENSURE THE KEYS WERE DELETED WHEN I ACCIDENTALLY CHECKED IN THE .ENV FILE.  GITHUB MAY HAVE BLOCKED IT HOWEVER I KEPT SEEING THE KEYS IN THE TERMINAL.  RATHER THAN CONTINUE, I BLEW OUT THE PROJECT AND RECREATED IT FROM SCRATCH... I DON'T TRUST COPILOT YET.  IT DOESN'T SEEM TO GIVE ME THE RIGHT ANSWERS.  SKIP TRING TO DO THIS AND MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS INCLUDE .ENV IN THE .GITIGNORE FILE AND ALL OF THIS IS MOOT.

Even though you've added `.env` to your `.gitignore`, Git is still tracking the file because it was previously committed. You need to remove it from Git's tracking while keeping the local file.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Remove the .env file from Git's tracking (but keep it locally)

```bash
# Remove .env from Git tracking but keep the local file
git rm --cached .env

# Verify it's been removed from tracking
git status
```

### 2. Commit this change

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove .env from Git tracking and update .gitignore"
```

### 3. Create a sample .env file (optional but recommended)

````bash
# Make a copy without sensitive data
cp .env .env.example
````

Then edit `.env.example` to replace all actual API keys with placeholders:

```bash
# Edit the file to remove secrets
# Replace API keys with placeholder text like:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 4. Add and commit the example file

```bash
git add .env.example
git commit -m "Add example environment file"
```

### 5. Now try pushing again

```bash
git push origin main
```

This should work because you've now:
1. Removed the sensitive .env file from Git tracking
2. Kept .env in your .gitignore to prevent it from being added again
3. Added a safe .env.example file that others can use as a template
